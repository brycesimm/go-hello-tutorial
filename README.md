# go-hello-tutorial
A tutorial from go.dev to create two modules that interact and build into one .exe to run

The greetings module has two functions, one that outputs one of 3 formatted responses using a name parameter, and another
that outputs a map of formatted responses using a names parameter

The project comes with a simple unit test file, greetings_test.go for both functions as well as a driver file, hello.go

Output running in the local directory after go build:
